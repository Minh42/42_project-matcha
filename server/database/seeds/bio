and i have plenty of time for the right man. in fact, it's a high priority for me to make time for a great man and create a great relationship together.","my spiritual life is quite significant, but the form is not rigid. i'm happier hiking, gardening, singing kirtan and bhajans, or going to a yoga class (all of those are spiritual for me) than going to church or temple although i can enjoy that too on occasion. my orientation to life is spiritual, has been my entire life and is well-integrated into my being so it's not critical for me to do spiritual things.","i'm quite self-sufficient, but much prefer partnership. i've gone from being super-competent, ultra-independent, feminist, do-everything-myself to being able to kindly ask for help, graciously accept it when it's offered, and be a feminine participant in the relationship. i'm very generous with the many feminine skills i possess. an ideal relationship for me has lots of mutual lavishing. interesting how when there's a lot of lavishing, there are very few issues....... :)","i know how to really accept another unconditionally and appreciate another fully. our chances for a really harmonious relationship increase tremendously if the same is true for you.","while having shared interests is nice, what is more important to me in a partner are kindness, self-acceptance, passion, respect, devotion to the relationship, personal responsibility, generosity, humor, lightness, fun, passion, honesty and openness. i offer all of these too.","i'm really comfortable with my sexuality as well as my libido. i'm also super affectionate and am extremely cuddly. if you are too, this could be delightful.","i'm active physically, love to hike, skate, walk, x/c ski, downhill too, snowshoe, swim, snorkel, love to dance- pretty much any kind of dance. if you'd be willing to take partner dance lessons, i'd be thrilled!","i don't do any intense gym workouts, rock climb or do xtreme sports. and i'm not interested in competition.","i also enjoy quiet indoor time reading, writing, movies, sitting in front of the fire, and hanging out together, doing domestic stuff, cooking together, baking alone or together.","i'm told that although i'm quite mature, i have a youthfulness and appearance younger than my years. for this reason (and a few others), i stated my age 3 years younger than actual. people usually don't believe me when i tell them my age. really.","wrt the okc enneagram test, i am an unconventional 9 with an 8 wing; i am not an 8. i'd especially love to hear from men who are well-integrated 6s.","i appreciate that it's a lot to read, but i find it saves us both a lot of time if we're really clear, self-revealing and specific. being","entrepreneur, healer, teacher, writer, artist, half-time parent of an 18 year old (she's leaving at the end of summer).","gardening, home repair, etc. (i welcome help/company in these activities! i suck at home repair tasks b/c i have no idea what to do and no skill/experience.).","doing my part to make the world a better place, being the change i want to see in the world, helping others to experience greater freedom, a greater sense of their soul's purpose, and greater fulfillment, joy and ease. the stuff in the previous section","relationships. being authentic, individuated, and expressive. communicating constructively, compassionately and effectively. enjoying, appreciating, giving and receiving. relaxing into whatever arises. allowing it to unfold on it's own (ok, i'm not actually good at allowing the unfolding all of the time..... yet, but i'm steadfast in practicing allowing it).","synthesizing seemingly disparate concepts and info. and explaining complex concepts in simple terms.","i very reluctantly admit to being a great cook b/c i don't cook that much anymore. however, i bake grain-free, sugar-free, gluten-free stuff that is seriously delicious and quite healthy. my warm eyes, my smile, or my long legs if i'm wearing a dress or skirt; and that i look way better in person than in my photos .","classy, sexy, and very very sweet.....men comment on my sweetness a lot! i guess i'm waaay sweeter than the average gal. and it's really genuine. books:","anything by anita shreve, annie proulx, alice hoffman, ann patchett, ursula hegi, wally lamb, janet fitch, ann lamott, and","all kinds of ethnic cuisines; i'm very adventurous with food: i love a great dive as much as fine dining, and i'm improvisational in the kitchen. i love cooking together.","gluten-free mac 'n cheese is probably my favorite food; my new fave is to add truffle oil: sublime!!!","after decades of cooking for others, if you cook for me, i'll probably be thrilled so long as it's not burnt; i'm a very appreciative audience! heck, i'll even wash the dishes.","quiet unstructured time, time to read, write, and allow myself time and space to contemplate. inspiration, silence, my connection with the divine, flow, creativity","my business, what it means to me to be a soulpreneur, how to work ever smarter-not-harder, how to be of even greater service, how to get more done while being in a state of flow, wondering if there's a way to set goals w/o my ego co-opting it, sacred commerce (business as a spiritual enterprise)........","wondering when i'm gonna meet a man who's a really good fit for me and has the capacity for a truly amazing partnership. netflix'g","although it's immediately obvious that i'm a strong person, i have a huge heart and i'm really just a big softie.","you have excellent relationship skills, great self-acceptance, self-awareness and a huge heart. you're happy, kind, compassionate and generous. your life works pretty well. you make an awesome ally, friend, and partner.","if you're ready for an amazing harmonious partnership and i sound like just what you've been hoping for.","i'm flexible about the age range i selected provided you're mature and youthful, healthy and active, and take good care of yourself.","***please don't waste your time or mine if you aren't what i've asked for or if i'm not what you're looking for regardless of how captivating you find my cleavage.","***please choose someone else if you have trouble receiving love or loving in a substantial way or if you tend to withdraw.","***and please understand that i'm looking for someone local so if you live outside the bay area or in another state, i wish you the best. white\",68,-1,\"other 2012-06-28-14-39 san rafael, california has a kid, but doesn&rsquo;t want more straight likes dogs and has cats other but not too serious about it f virgo but it doesn&rsquo;t matter no english single\" 59,\"average anything socially never graduated from college/university hopefulromantic was taken and 2hopefulromantic was too long... lost the \"\"c\"\". oh well ...","where do i start. okay, i am a simple human being, yet with a deep soul, who has a heart of gold and who believes in fairy tales. however, i also believe that the pillars of any successful relationship are understanding, loyalty, honesty, compromise, the will to make things work, communication and respect. i believe in fate too and that people meet for a purpose of higher nature and that there is a reason for everything.","good luck in your search. im sure you will meet someone who fits you) do masters degree with concentration in integrated marketing communications, painiting/doing graphic design, go out regulary, go to tahoe almost every week, play soccer twice a week, hang out with friends almost everything! especially snowboarding, skateboarding, soccer  i like to read things like \"\"hot, flat and crowded\"\" by thomas friedman."]
